# 1D-Burgers-PINN
This repository contains a Python implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the 1D Burgers' Equation. The project serves as a foundational study for using PINNs in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) related to fluid dynamics and is a preparatory step for advanced modeling like heart valve flow.
